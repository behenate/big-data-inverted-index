# Inverted Index 🔄
Created for Big Data course at Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria

### Description
This project focused on implementing an _Inverted Index_, which contains _Crawler_, _Indexer_ and _Search Engine_. These 3 together allow us to crawl books from gutenberg.org data source, format them properly into inverted index and then search in them by words really fast! 📬

To implement _Inverted index_ we tried two different approaches: saving data in SQLite - local, file-based, relational database. Quite fast in quering and easy to configure database appeared to be an ideal choice for us. Another approach was using JSON file to save the created index. Results came out very interesting!
